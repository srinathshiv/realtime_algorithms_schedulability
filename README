Info:
[1] proj-1.c is the source code for qsn1
[2] proj-1.cpp is the source code for qsn2. We used c++ 
    for question2 because c++ has a builtin uniform 
    distribution generator.
[3] input.txt containes taskset data for qsn1

Execution procedure:
[1] make all  - compiles for qsn1 and qsn2 and generates qsn1.o and qsn2.o
[2] make qsn1 - compiles for qsn1 only and generates qsn1.o
[3] make qsn2 - compiles for qsn2 only and generates qsn2.0
[4] make run  - executes both qsn1.o and qsn2.o
[5] make run1 - executes qsn1.o only
    ./qsn1.0 input.txt
[6] make run2 - executes qsn2.o only
    ./qsn2.0 0.5 e
    First argument(0.5)represents utilization
    Second argument(e) represnets the scheduling procedure
       [a] e for edf
       [b] r for rms
       [c] d for dms
